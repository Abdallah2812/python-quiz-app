This project is a console-based Python Quiz Application designed to provide an interactive quiz experience for users. 
The application allows users to add and manage quiz questions, take timed quizzes, and receive instant feedback on their answers. 
It supports both Multiple Choice (MCQ) and True/False (TF) question types, with questions organized into different categories.
The system is built using a modular and object-oriented approach, where each major functionality is handled by a dedicated class. 
Quiz results are recorded, performance reports can be viewed, and analytical data such as average score and best score can be generated and exported. 
This project demonstrates the use of Python programming concepts including file handling, user input validation, and basic analytics.
